= Development Setup with Vite =

Kurv Knowledgebase 2026 uses Vite for fast development and optimized production builds. The theme has source files in the `src/` directory that are compiled to the theme root.

Installation instructions

1. Using a command line interface, navigate to the theme directory:
   `cd /path/to/wp-content/themes/kurv-knowledgebase-2026`

2. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`

3. The dependencies may take a few minutes to download but once it completes, you're ready to develop.

Development workflow

1. **Development mode** (with hot module replacement):
   `npm run dev`
   
   This starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement. Changes to files in `src/` will be automatically reflected in the browser.

2. **Production build**:
   `npm run build`
   
   This creates optimized, minified production builds:
   - `style.css` and `style.min.css` in the theme root
   - `assets/css/editor-style.css` and `assets/css/editor-style.min.css`
   - `assets/js/main.js` (minified in production)

3. **Watch mode** (build on file changes):
   `npm run watch`
   
   This watches for changes and automatically rebuilds without starting a dev server.

File structure

- `src/css/` - Source CSS files
- `src/js/` - Source JavaScript files
- `src/assets/` - Source assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- Theme root - Compiled output files

Important notes

- Always edit files in the `src/` directory, not the compiled output files
- The compiled `style.css` and `style.min.css` files are generated automatically
- Use the Site Editor's "Additional CSS" feature for customizations when possible
- Source maps are generated in development mode for easier debugging
